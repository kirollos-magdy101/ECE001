<b><u>The First Generation (1940's to early 1950's)</u></b>
</h2>
<p class="giveMargin">
	They were created when electronic computers were first introduced in the 1940s without any operating systems. All programming was done in absolute machine language, often by cabled plugboards to control the basic functions of the machine. Operating systems were not really required during this period computers were usually used for solving basic math calculations</p>

<b><u>The Second Generation (1955-1965)</u></b>
</h2>
<p class="giveMargin">
	In the early 1950s the first operating system was introduced, it was called GMOS, and it was created by General Motors for the 701 machine of IBM. Single-stream batch processing systems were called operating systems in the 1950's because the data was submitted in groups. Such modern computers were called mainframes, and professional operators used them in large computing rooms. Since there was such as high price tag on these machines, only government agencies or large corporations were able to afford them</p>			
<h2><b><u>The Third Generation (1965-1980)</u></b>
</h2>
<p class="giveMargin">
	By the late 1960s, operating systems designers were able to develop a multiprogramming system in which a computer program can perform multiple jobs simultaneously. The implementation of multiprogramming was a big part of the operating system growth as it required a CPU to be busy almost 100 percent of the time it was in operation. Another significant advancement during the third generation was the exponential growth of minicomputers, starting with the 1961 DEC PDP-1. The PDP-1 had just 4 K of 18-bit words but it sold like hotcakes at $120,000 per computer (less than 5% of a 7094's price). These microcomputers help build a whole new industry and further PDP's grow. These PDP's are helped to lead to the creation of personal computers which are created in the fourth generation. </p>
<h2><b><u>The Fourth Generation (1980-Present Day)</u></b></h2>
<p class="giveMargin">
	Personal computing was developed in fourth generation of operating systems. Though these computers were somewhat similar to the third-generation minicomputers built, personal computers cost a very small fraction of what minicomputers cost. A desktop computer was so cheap that a single user could own it for desktop use while mini-computers were already at such a high price that only businesses could afford to get one. The founding of Microsoft and the Windows operating system was one of the main influences in developing personal computing. The windows operating system was developed in 1975, when there was a dream for Paul Allen and Bill Gates to move personal computing to the next level. They introduced the MS-DOS in 1981, although it was effective for people who tried to understand their cryptic commands to create a lot of difficulty. With releases of Windows 95, Windows 98 , Windows XP (which is currently the most used operating system to this day), and their newest Windows 7 operating system, Windows went on to become the largest operating system used in technology today. Apple is the other major operating system, created in the 1980s, along with Microsoft. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs created the Apple Macintosh which was a tremendous success because it was so user friendly. The Macintosh influenced the development of Windows during the later years and it created a strong competition between the two companies. Today all of our electronic gadgets operate from operating systems to ATM equipment and motor cars, from our laptops and smartphones. And operating systems do likewise as technology advances.  </p>
