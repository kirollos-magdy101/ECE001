	Since 1985 Microsoft Windows has existed in one form or another, and it remains the most popular home and office computer operating system. Its latest versions are also used on some tablets, including Windows 10, and the OS is also used on some web and number-crunching server computers. Windows can be used by machines from a wide number of vendors. </p>

	Initial Windows versions operated with an earlier Microsoft operating system called MS-DOS, offering a new graphical gui alongside conventional text-based commands from DOS. The Microsoft Windows user interface's signature features include windows themselveson-panel, rectangle-shaped screens that represent individual applications. The Windows Start menu has helped generations of users to find files and programs on their devices. Efforts to use versions of the Windows OS have been less popular for smartphones. </p>

	Android is the world's most common operating system judged by the number of smartphones it has built. Google's largely developed; it's mainly used on smartphones and tablets. It can be used on devices made by a variety of different manufacturers, unlike iOS, and those manufacturers can tweak parts of their interface to suit their own needs. Because large portions of it are open source, users can download custom versions of the operating system, meaning anyone can legally modify it and publish their own. Most people however tend to stick to the version that comes on their computers</p>

	Apple's macOS, a successor to the popular OS X operating system, is running on laptops and desktops from Apple. Based in part on the historic UNIX family of operating systems from research at AT&T's Bell Labs in the 1960s, macOS shares certain features with other Unix-related operating systems including Linux. While the graphical interfaces are different, many of the underlying programming interfaces and command line features are the same</p>

	Unlike many other operating systems, no single company leads development on Linux. In 1991 the Finnish programmer Linus Torvalds created the operating system. Programmers from around the world are now collaborating on its open source code and submitting tweaks to the central kernel software and other programs</p>
	<p class="giveMargin">
	Linux offers a wide range of commercial and open source software, and various Linux distributions provide custom user interfaces and tools to install software on operating system machines. Linux is a favorite of many programmers, and is widely used on corporate and scientific servers, including cloud computing. Linux can be run on a wide variety of hardware and is available free of charge over the internet. </p>
