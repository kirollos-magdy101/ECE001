				Abstract

			</h2>
				
					<p class="giveMargin">
						Many modern devices, including web servers, database engines, and operating system kernels, utilize language-based defense mechanisms to provide the reliability and dignity that hardware historically provides. Provided that these language-based systems are used in more difficult circumstances, they pose the same challenges as conventional operating systems they solved namely mutual resource control, division of operations, and accounting of resources by process. While several gradual improvements have been suggested to language-based, extensible frameworks, this study demonstrates that robust approaches found in conventional operating systems remain relevant and acceptable. Alta supports nested processes, and communication between processes. Java programs running on Alta will build child processes and control the resources of those processes the world. Alta shows that the Java environment suffices to host traditional abstractions of the operating system. Alta extends the nested process model to include Java-specific tools, such as class files, modifies the model to exploit Java-type protection, and extends the Java-type framework to allow secure, fine-grained sharing among different applications. Available Java apps on Alta function unchanged. Alta is comparable to Fluke and the conventional hardware-based operating systems in terms of configuration, deployment and performance. A short collection of research programs illustrates robust regulation of memory use and file access at program level.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="giveMargin">
	An Operating System (OS) acts as a connecting interface between computer user and computer hardware. An operating system falls within the system software category, which performs all fundamental tasks such as file management, memory handling, process management, input/output handling, and peripheral devices such as disk drives, networking hardware, printers

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p class="giveMargin">
					We started with a brief overview of the personal computer industry and the role of operating systems within the industry in this case. We also looked at the operating systems industry's present position and addressed the implications of network-related impacts on that industry. The dominant force on the OS market is the indirect network effect, as the related systems hardware, peripherals, and software applications markets are all factors in any particular OS 's success. The path-dependence of the personal computer industry and the user lock-in is another crucial force. Finally, we applied our methodology to the market and Microsoft and Apple in particular, and studied the tactics that decided their popularity. To know from Microsoft's Windows and Apple MacOS tutorials, we understand that network effects may really dominate an market and industries that are not optimized to compensate for such effects might well be in trouble. Microsoft realized the importance of network effects and made the most of the MS-DOS base it had already installed. The upgrade path to Windows was manageable but not easy, due to human factors such as unwillingness to learn another environment, switching costs. Nevertheless, owing to the Windows platform's dominance over MS-DOS and early 90's explosion of PCs in both the corporate and home markets, Windows quickly became the dominant operating system. Apple's Macintosh, in retrospect, could have really succeeded.
